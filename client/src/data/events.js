/**
 * SRIJAN 2026 — CENTRALIZED EVENT DATA ARCHITECTURE
 * 
 * ==============================================================================
 * INSTRUCTIONS FOR EDITING:
 * 1. Replace placeholder event names, descriptions, dates, and venues below.
 * 2. Replace the 'registrationUrl' with your actual Google Form URL for each event.
 * 3. Place your event brochure PDF files inside: 'client/public/brochures/'
 *    (e.g., 'client/public/brochures/event-1.pdf').
 * 4. Set 'brochureAvailable: true' once you have placed the PDF in the brochures folder.
 * 5. Update rules, team size, and contact details as needed.
 * 
 * NOTE FOR FUTURE BACKEND INTEGRATION:
 * When moving to full MERN stack (Express + MongoDB), this array can be directly
 * replaced with an API call: `GET /api/events` without changing any frontend UI components.
